    <p>This easy banana bread is quick to prepare, and everyone always comes back for seconds!</p>
    <p>I have so many memories of my mom making banana bread while I was growing up. I absolutely loved this stuff, and I still do. Whether it's fresh out of the oven with a pat of butter melting on it, or it's fully cooled down and enjoyed with some hot chocolate, this iconic treat will always satisfy.</p>

        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
