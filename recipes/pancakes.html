    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>
    <p>This recipe contains many of the same ingredients you would typically find in any pancake recipe. What truly sets it apart is the amount of love that goes into the preparation. Above all else, ensure that you are in the proper headspace before setting out to construct this marvelous concoction.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
